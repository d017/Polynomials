### Monomial
A class representing monomials, kind of base class to class Polynomial, because any operations with polynomials can be reduced to series of operations with monomials.
**Supported operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication.**
*Useful methods:*
- Monomial.copy():
	Returns a new Monomial, completely similar to the current one.
### Polynomial
A class representing polynomials. 
**Supported operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, raising to natural power.**
*Useful methods:*
- Polynomial.copy():
	Returns a new Polynomial, completely similar to the current one.
